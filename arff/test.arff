'Why Him? painfully runs out of ideas and steam as it progress, quickly becoming insipid and flat and leaving you aghast at how much it wastes the combination of James Franco and Bryan Cranston.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a long stretch part-way through Why Him? where there are absolutely zero laughs. I can roughly estimate that it lasted somewhere between 15 to 30 minutes, but as the dry spell dragged on and on it began to feel more like days and weeks. Sure, things happen that you politely smile at, but there\'s a severe lack of effort to genuinely push Why Him? to the comedic heights that it has all the ingredients to hit.\r\n\r\nThis is indicative of why Why Him? ultimately falters and descends into the witless and mirthless abyss that it circles for most of its run, only to briefly escape thanks to the intervention of James Franco, Megan Mullally, and especially Keegan Michael-Key. Not Bryan Cranston, though, who furiously bumbles around the film like an incensed child in a supermarket that you just have to contend with to save embarrassment.\r\n\r\nWhy is Bryan Cranston\'s Ned Fleming so furious? Because his daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) has found a boyfriend who\'s a little unconventional in the shape of tech billionaire Laird Mayhew (James Franco), who also wants to ask Ned\'s permission for her hand in marriage. Ned isn\'t so eager to grant him his wish, having been put off by his potty-mouth and rather outrageous personality. Stephanie is quite taken with Laird, though, so insists that her dad gives him a second chance over the next five days leading up to Christmas, which her mother Barb (Megan Mullally) and younger brother Scott (Griffin Gluck) have also flown out to California from Michigan for.\r\n\r\nThe problem is Why Him? doesn\'t actually pit James Franco against Bryan Cranston enough. Even the scenes where their conflict comes to a head feel overly familiar, and a little rushed and tame, as the same old father in the wrong place at the wrong time and thus hearing his daughter in a compromising position, mother being stoned, and innocent young son being scarred and slightly injured scenarios are rolled out. It\'s a waste of the actors, as Franco\'s ability to annoy without grating and Cranston\'s at being furious without overselling should have been a perfect match.\r\n\r\nJames Franco is able to get in a few laughs. Especially when he\'s introducing the Fleming\'s to his decadent pad, and he can\'t stop swearing, immediately warping the mind of 15-year-old Scotty, and reveals a little bit too much about his first intimate time with Stephanie. During this spell you can see Bryan Cranston scoping him out, but then Laird starts to come across as nothing but likeable, with a few dollops of eccentricity, so when Ned erupts and tries to stop Stephanie from seeing him, which he does so by severely crossing the line, you just feel annoyed and disappointed by his actions.\r\n\r\nAll of this would have been fine if Why Him? had possessed some hearty laughs. But it just doesn\'t. Keegan Michael-Key, who portrays Laird\'s estate-manager/butler Gustav, assisting Ned on the toilet after the Japanese flush breaks is the one scene that really works, as it\'s drawn out in an increasingly awkward manner that Key, Cranston, and Megan Mullally are able to make even more excruciating. That\'s about it, though.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tech billionaire angle isn\'t explored or played up enough, and while there are cameos from Elon Musk, Andrew Rannells (Girls), Adam DeVine (Workaholics), Steve Aoki, and Casey Wilson (Happy Endings) they fail to add anything, with their presences seemingly deemed enough. Only the use of Kaley Cuoco (The Big Bang Theory) as the voice of Laird\'s in-home artificial intelligence unit gets some chortles, but even they\'re few and far between.\r\n\r\nWhy Him? painfully runs out of ideas and steam as it progress, quickly becoming insipid and flat and leaving you aghast at how much it wastes the combination of James Franco and Bryan Cranston. Some scenes literally come to an end without a joke, thus immediately sapping the miniscule amount of goodwill the film had acquired. Director John Hamburg tries his best to inject a sense of urgency and pace, but the script, which was written by Hamburg himself and Ian Helfter is just too lacking.\r\n\r\nWhich isn\'t good enough considering that the duo, who devised the story with Jonah Hill, must have believed that could bring something fresh, modern, and original to a plot that\'s been done dozens of times before. But instead they just waste everyone\'s time.\r\n',neg
'Lion literally earns every heartstring tug with its impossible story of rediscovering ones childhood with the help of cutting-edge technology and good, old-fashioned resolve.\r\n\r\nOn paper, Lion shouldn\'t work. The premise, when said aloud, seems so laughable that there should be no way that a dramatic feature can sustain the improbability of the situation, despite the fact that it\'s based on a true story -- one in which a grown man uses Google Maps to locate his remote home village after being away for decades. And yet, the movie hits its marks, thanks primarily to an open-hearted performance by Dev Patel, and an engrossing opening act that establishes the reality of one man\'s unusual predicament, so that we believe the story every step of the way.\r\n\r\nBut why is it called Lion? The answer comes at the very end of the film, and by that point, you will be sobbing into soaking wet tissues because Patel and director Garth Davis will have successfully navigated you through an emotional journey of familial support and discovery. And it\'s worth every step taken on that path, starting with the introduction of 5-year-old Indian boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar), who lives with his mother and older brother in the Ganesh Tilai neighborhood of Khandwa, India. One evening, while following his brother to a job site, Saroo is separated from his older sibling, and ends up on a train that takes him miles from home. It takes him 25 years to return.\r\n\r\nLion explains how Saroo gets back home, and man, is it an impossible journey. It\'s not all terrible. Working off of Saroo Brierley\'s autobiographical book A Long Way Home, Garth Davis spends the proper amount of time following a lost, confused and terrified Saroo as the child tries to make sense of his situation. He passes through the hands of several strangers over the course of weeks and months until, finally, he is adopted by John (David Wenham) and Sue Brierley (Nicole Kidman), Aussies who raise the young boy as their own.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Lion fast forwards two decades, and we\'re still in the basic mechanics of the plot. Saroo, now played by Patel, is a well-balanced college student with supportive parents, a mentally-disabled step-brother (Divian Ladwa), and a progressive girlfriend (Rooney Mara, the only actor in this cast who seems out of place). During a discussion with classmates, Saroo begins to question his heritage, and with the help of modern technologies -- specifically Google Earth -- he wonders if he could ever deduce which Indian village he once called home.\r\n\r\nAnd do you know what? Even without me telling you how Saroo\'s adventure concludes, it\'s miraculous how his story -- and this movie -- makes the world feel smaller, and makes our global community feel more connected. Lion takes Saroo\'s quest and turns it into a technological mystery, with an emotional goal on the other side of the finish line. And instead of being hokey, the use of Google Maps to piece together the scraps of Saroo\'s childhood memories have a sense of urgency (credit to Davis for figuring out how to make the act of Patel perched in front of a computer screen compelling).\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t quite enough for Lion to sustain tension over the course of its complete run time. The conflicts Patel has with Rooney Mara are forced and empty, though Patel connects with Ladwa as \"brothers\" paired by parents they really can\'t call their own. But the underlying maternal disconnect felt between Kidman and Patel comes home to roost when Lion arrives at its overwhelmingly satisfying conclusion. In a season of cinematic tearjerkers, from the devastating (A Monster Calls) to the cynical (Collateral Beauty), Lion literally earns every heartstring tug with its impossible story of rediscovering ones childhood with the help of cutting-edge technology and good, old-fashioned resolve.',pos
'This was a disappointment. David Webb\'s father was killed by a car bomb in Lebanon and, of course, it was the duplicitous American government who killed him. They are always the real source of violence in the Mideast, of course. And the father was killed because the CIA absolutely had to have his son in the organization and the father objected. The American government always kills parents who disapprove of a job candidate\'s choice. And the father objected because he \"did not want his son to be a killer\". The sons current job when he applied- Delta Force Operator!!! They never kill anybody. The father seemed to have no objection to Delta Force. Only objecting to the evil CIA- which the father worked for. Convoluted logic!\r\nAccording to the Legacy version, the CIA could make supermen from simpletons with the \"meds\". Why did they absolutely have to have this candidate, so they kill the father to get this key cantidate?\r\nAnd lastly the characters have become so superhuman that its like terminator now. Lets fall off a 5 storey building onto concrete and run away. Then lets get shot and run a 5K after the bad guy. They should have the next installment as a cartoon, because it has gotten so bad!!!

'I really don\'t know what to say after viewing Martin Scorsese\'s mesmerizing three-hour+ made for PBS film except that I am truly impressed. And although it is more of a chronicle of an era (the early 1960\'s and what lead to Dylan\'s fame) then a biography of Bob Dylan I was surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did. At first I was skeptical, I thought it had pretensions of grandeur: Dylan/and Scorsese? I mean come on guys!? But the piece delivered. It was cut in such a way that seemed to create drama out of raw material. Although ponderous at times the film not only held my interest but made me want to find out more about Bob Dylan, the NYC folk scene, Pete, Seger, Woody Guthrie, Allen Ginsberg, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez and many others. The interviews were fascinating, humorous and sometimes truly educational. There is a purpose and a true sense of that time to the film that is unlike most other \"rock\" documentaries. In one of my favorite interviews in the film Bob Neuwirth explains how in the early 60\'s money (financial success) was not an issue when it came to the arts. Back then it was about if an artist had something to say. Weather it was Bob Dylan or Ornette Coleman what people would ask was \"does he (the artist) have something to say.\" Money and the \"bottom line\" didn\'t enter into the equation. It was a whole different world back then. Neuwirth states this so glibly that you\'ll wish you had a time-machine to go back and check it out for yourself. I have at least one friend who was disappointed in the film. He felt that it didn\'t illuminate the life of Dylan enough in that it ends in 1966 with him being \"booed\" offstage for \"going electric.\" But apparently this is all Dylan wanted to reveal for this film. He (and his people) gave Martin Scorsese specific instructions to only chronicle this period. Scorsese was asked to sort through hours of material (including 10-hours of recent Dylan interviews). The result is amazing considering these limitations. Instead of illuminating the Dylan myth the film uses \"myth\" to stir a powerful narrative, one that rivals many of Scosese\'s latest cinematic endeavors. Perhaps another director would have tried to create something more definitive regarding the details of Dylans life and songwriting process but Scorsese has always favored myth over reality in him films. And in the case of No Direction Home I believe he mixes together the perfect combination of myth, mystery and reality. Sure there are great Dylan performances throughout the feature but they are tied together by a larger narrative which is the journey of an artist (at a particular stage in his life). Some of the highlights for me musically and otherwise were Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival where he has trouble tuning his guitar but still comes off as some sort of \"folk messiah\" to the folkies present ( was that scene even real?! ), Al Kooper talking about how he came up for the organ part for Like a Rolling Stone (hilarious). Dylan performing (if only snippets of, sigh…) \"Masters of War,\" and his \"Hard Rain\" and the final performance of the film (Like a Rolling Stone) when Dylan summons his band (the Band) to \"play it f*ck#ng loud!\" in order offset the hecklers booing his electric set in England in 1966. Ironically I recently read a quote from Jim Jarmusch talking about NYC in the late 1970\'s, he said, \"I feel so lucky. During the late 70\'s in New York, anything seemed possible. You could make a movie or a record and work part time, and you could find an apartment for 160 bucks a month. And the conversations were about ideas. No one was talking about money. It was pretty amazing. But looking back is dangerous. I don\'t like nostalgia. But, still, damn, it was fun. I\'m glad I was there.\" Be it the early 1960\'s or the late 1970\'s perhaps the charm and \"myth\" of such an era inspired Dylan and company to chronicle only his \"golden era\" as opposed to trying to trace his entire career ( which could have proved to be less then fruitful ). Instead we get a wonderful slice of life about a great time in American History, about a great artist and put together on film by a great filmmaker. I\'m not going to complain. ',pos
'This movie without giving away the plot, was shot in the same camera style as the past movies. This doesn\'t mean it\'s bad. This movie brings closer to the forefront, how the life of the character Jason Bourne came to be with many surprises. They did leave this movies end open for another installment but with Damon aging, how much longer can they run this series?\r\nThe action is pretty good and the typical run around the globe to achieve his goals. Would I recommend this movie? absolutely! but if you\'re new to the series, watch the last movies (With Matt Damon only) to understand where this movie comes in. They seamlessly meshed this iteration into the series.',pos
'On the surface Inception seems to be a crime caper, complete with master of disguise Eames (Tom Hardy), planner Aridane (Ellen Page), point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and master thief Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio). But it\'s so much more than that, taking place in dreams within dreams within dreams.\r\n\r\nInception, like Total Recall and The Matrix, is about perception. The audience is never sure what reality is because the protagonist isn\'t sure what\'s real. There are clues providing evidence for the real/not real theories, but the best movies of this type don\'t come down on one side or another. Total Recall ultimately had enough clues indicating the \"right\" way. The Matrix stumbled after it made it clear that reality was fiction, thereby losing an audience who enjoyed the tantalizing mystery. Like so many mysteries, once the truth was revealed it wasn\'t quite as exciting as we all hoped. Inception wisely avoids providing answers.\r\n\r\nInception is also a thought experiment. The central conceit of Inception is that once you put a thought in someone\'s head it\'s like a virus, incapable of being removed. In fact, attempting to not think about the idea causes the mind to just focus on it more. This concept, a key tenet of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), is part of how our brains are wired. Director Chris Nolan knows exactly what he\'s doing when the characters explain the premise. It is the key argument between Cobb and his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard): is this life just a dream?\r\n\r\nOnce you get it into your head as to which of them is right, Inception burrows into your psyche and you see all the evidence you need to reinforce the idea',pos
